        description: "Walk through Exergy's real-world installation: a water-cooled Bitcoin miner heating The Space's radiant floors via a plumber-led hydronic loop. We'll dissect control gaps (no fixed outlet temps, dynamic wattage-to-heat conversion) and workshop solutions to replicate traditional boiler logic atop hashrate heating. Join hydronics experts to confront the quirks of \"smart heat\" and define next-gen control schemas."

This session dissects CAPEX tradeoffs (new vs. depreciated ASICs), duty-cycle optimization for maximum hardware utilization, and hybrid integration strategies. Learn to balance precision sizing against analysis paralysis while maximizing client savings in climates where heat pumps underperform."

The 256 Foundation (501c3) is rebuilding mining's core stack as open infrastructure: HydraPool (FOSS pool), Mujina (firmware), Ember One (hashboard), and Libre Board (controller). These reference designs enable auditability, eliminate backdoors, and return mining to its trustless roots. Join core developers to learn how this Linux-like foundation secures all hashrate—from heatpunk heaters to industrial farms—and how you can accelerate the open-source takeover."
